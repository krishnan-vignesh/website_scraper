Xylella:Spreads by people moving infected plant propagative material, and transmission by insect vectors which spread the pathogen to other plants. It is not carried on, or spread by seeds. Grows within the xylem and clogs the water flow vessels of the plant causing the plant to dehydrate and eventually die.Symptoms vary between hosts and can be easily confused with water stress or the presence of other pathogens.Main symptoms are:scorching of leavesbrowning and loss of leavesstunting of young shootsgradual reduction in fruit size over timedieback and eventual death of the plant.

Some plants can be infected with xylella but not show any symptoms or significant effects. Virtually all sucking insects that feed on a host plantâ€™s xylem fluid are potential vectors of xylella, such as:sharpshootersspittlebugsrelated leafhoppers.Significant vectors such as meadow spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius) and the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), which are not in Australia, have aided the establishment and significantly increased the impact of xylella in other countries. Spittlebugs are usually less that 13 mm but may be up to 27 mm; while sharpshooters and froghoppers in size from 2-30 mm but averaging 13 mm.

The most likely way for exotic  fruit flies to enter Australia is in infested fruit, or from natural movement  into northern Australia through the Torres Strait.  Tephritidae and Drosophilidae  are two fly families which include fruit flies. Tephritids are 2.5â€“10  mm, often colourful with pictured  wings. Drosophilidae are 2â€“4 mm  long, typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, often with red  eyes and sometimes with distinct black patterns on the wings.  Exotic fruit flies present in other countries pose high risks to our agricultural industries, including: Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis)Melon fly (Zeugodacus cucurbitae)Mexican fruly  fly (Anastrepha ludens) Spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila  suzukii).

Some of these  exotic species are regularly detected in the Torres Strait during the wet  season, and are eradicated annually to ensure they do not move southwards, and  into production areas on the mainland.Considerable damage can occur inside  the fruit before any obvious infestations are visible. Discoloured patches on  the skin are the most obvious signs of infestation. Symptoms found on the fruit  and vegetables can be very similar to those caused by native flies such as the  Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni).  Fruit flies create damage to the  fruit by causing rots and discolouration. Eggs are laid close to the surface  inside the fruit with small discoloured patches developing as a result of the  stings. After hatching from the eggs, the larvae (maggots) tunnel deep into the  fruit while feeding, causing considerable damage inside the fruit. The affected  fruit then begins to rot and often falls prematurely from the plant. 
Fruit damaged by fruit flies Source: preventfruitfly.com.au 
Any  unprotected fruit will likely be damaged.
Tephritid flies can develop from eggs to adults  in about four to five weeks. Eggs are about 1 to 2 millimetres long, white and  quickly develop into maggots which drink the rotting pulp. Larvae, or maggots  are creamy white and up to about 12 to 20mm long.  The  difference between exotic fruit flies and native fruit flies in Australia are  slight and not usually evident to the naked or untrained eye.  More information on accurately identifying  fruit flies can be found in the 
         Australian Handbook for the  Identification of Fruit Flies.ImportersAll commercial imports of fruit and vegetables are treated  or are certified as being grown in fruit fly-free zones or areas. If you work  around imported goods you should still be vigilant for fruit flies and unusual  damage in fruit and vegetables. Evident damage may include discoloured patches  and soft fruit.TravellersAll plant products, including fresh fruit and vegetables must  be declared on the Incoming Passenger Card when entering Australia. These  products must be accompanied by a valid import permit or they will be  destroyed. Leave any fruit on the aircraft.When travelling throughout Australia, be aware of  restrictions that may apply to the movement of fruit and vegetables to each  state and territory. Check

It is easiest to detect symptoms after the grain has been  harvested because there are usually only a few partially infected grains in  each wheat head.        Visible symptoms of the fungus:Black masses of spores on sections of the grain  which crush easily into a black powder, and produce an odour like rotten fish.Similarities exist with common bunt which is found in  Australia, however, Karnal bunt tends to infest only part of the seed head.

Infested wheat head Source: forestyimages.org 
Karnal bunt can reduce grain quality by causing an  objectionable odour and taste to the grain and to products made from infected  grain. Only three per cent of grain needs to be infected before consumers can  taste and smell the fishy odour, rendering the grain unsaleable.

The disease is more easily found in grain  after harvest.  Check  harvested grain regularly:Examine the grain.Note any unpleasant or fishy smell. If there is an  unpleasant odour but no obviously abnormal seeds, the bunt balls may have all  been broken up and the spores spread throughout the grain.Look for discoloured grey or black seeds. Pick out  a few of the discoloured seeds. Rub them between thumb and forefinger. Does the  grain crush and release a black powder? 
            
No: if the grain  is dark at one end, the condition is black point. Depending on the level of  black point in the sample, the grain may be downgraded (check local quality  requirements).
Yes: if the powder  has a foul smell, the grain is affected by either common bunt or Karnal bunt.  Sometimes loose smut does not completely disperse before harvest and some  pieces can find their way into the sample.Look at how much of the seed has been replaced  by bunt. Common bunt usually replaces the whole seed, whereas Karnal bunt  usually only replaces part of the seed.

Huanglongbing is  spread by the movement of infected plants and plant propagative material and by  sap sucking insects. These insects â€“ the Asiatic citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) and African citrus  psyllid (Trioza erytreae) â€“ are not  present in Australia and are of major concern due to their ability to spread  huanglongbing.Adults  of the Asiatic citrus psyllid are 3-4 millimeters long with brown markings on  the wings. When feeding on the veins of the young leaves, they adopt a  â€˜head-down, tail-upâ€™ position.Juvenile  psyllids are yellow and commonly found feeding on young, soft shoots.The  African citrus psyllid is similar but larger with a light brown-grey body and  black head, and large transparent forewings.
Psyllids 
        Huanglongbing  causes yellowing of citrus plant leaves and in some instances deformed, sour and bitter fruit.        Symptoms  on leaves are subtle and hard to pick but one key sign is a blotchy yellowing  that is not symmetrical or mirrored on both sides of the leaf. Later, new young  leaves are small, upright and yellow, with green bands around the veins.In  well-managed orchards, a yellowing that spreads slowly over the tree and  through an orchard is an easily seen sign. The spreading yellowing effect can be especially  hard to see in neglected backyard citrus trees growing in poor soils.

However, when compared with aphids, they are more active  and jump readily when disturbed. They are most commonly found on new, tender  growth of any commercially grown citrus, as well as some Australian native  citrus.Keep a  watch for sick citrus trees in your area.

The gypsy moth would most likely enter Australia in the egg  stage, as it spends a significant proportion of its life cycle on non-host  material as eggs. Asian gypsy moth egg masses are tolerant of extremes in  temperature and moisture. Egg masses can be transported domestically or  internationally on:cargo shipscommoditiescontainersfreightnursery stockplant partsvehicles.The flight season (July â€“ September) until hatching time  (April â€“ May) is the most likely period that viable eggs could enter Australia.Caterpillars  have a significant appetite and high populations can completely defoliate trees  causing them to die. Two to three years of  defoliation often result in significant tree death, especially if the trees are  also stressed by drought.

Gypsy  moths produce one generation per year and mature through four main life stages.They begin as tiny eggs laid in large masses.  The egg masses are covered in yellowish hair, are about 20 by 40 millimetres in  size and can contain more than 1000 eggs.The freshly hatched hairy larvae can spin silk  threads helping them balloon (drift on air currents) for up to eight kilometres,  if weather conditions are right.Later stages of larvae vary in colour but have  two distinctive rows of raised spots along the back â€“ usually five pairs of  blue and six pairs of red from head to tail.The larvae then pupate and emerge as adults.Adult males are of a grey-brown colour and a wingspan of  30-40mm and females are pale yellow with wavy dark brown bands across the  forewing and have a wingspan of 40-70mm.

Internal and external bee mites pose a high biosecurity risk  to Australia because of their effect on European honey bee hives and the  subsequent effect on pollination-dependent  plant industries.
Tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) are internal,  microscopic parasites in the honey bee respiratory system and feed on the beeâ€™s  blood. They spend their whole life inside adult honey bees, except for mature  females, which leave the host to attach to younger honey bees through bee to  bee contact.The  mites affect the honey beeâ€™s capacity to breathe, make the beeâ€™s respiratory  system susceptible to infection and reduces air flow to the wing muscles.This  results in weakened and sick honey bees which do not work as hard and have a significantly  reduced lifespan.Tracheal  mite infestation can lead to the death of the colony, if it is combined with  other stresses such as disease or lack of food.

Tropilaelaps mites (Tropilaelaps clareae and 
         
Tropilaelaps  mercedesae) are active, tiny external parasites that feed on the blood  of drone and worker bee pupae. Adult mites lay eggs in the brood cells of honey  bee larvae and feed on developing honey bees.Infestation  results in the transmission of honey bee viruses, such as deformed wing virus,  and causes the death of many pupae.This  results in an irregular brood, deformed honey bees with missing legs or wings,  and a reduced weight and life span of adult bees.Irregular  and poor brood patterns are also common, as nurse bees try to clean out the  sick or infected pupae.Heavy  infestation of tropilaelaps mites will invariably lead to the colony leaving  the hive, or colony collapse.

Varroa mites (Varroa destructor and 
         
Varroa  jacobosoni) are small red-brown external parasites of adult honey bees,  and drone and worker bee brood. Varroa mites feed and reproduce on larvae and  pupae, causing deformities and weakening of honey bees as well as transmitting  numerous viruses.
Varroa destructor affects both Asian honey bee and European honey  bee, and has caused the collapse and death of European honey bee colonies  wherever it is present.
Varroa jacobosoni occurs on Asian honey bee and is only very rarely known to affect European  honeybee in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.

Phytophthora blight,http://www.agriculture.gov.au//pests-diseases-weeds/plant/phytophthora-blight,http://www.agriculture.gov.au//SiteCollectionImages/pests-diseases-weeds/16.airborne-phytophthora.jpg,"Exotic to Australia,Life form: OomyceteOrigin: AsiaDistribution: North America and EuropeFeatures: Oomycete causing leaf spots, shoot/branch dieback and stem cankers which often ooze dark red sap and have a fermentation odour, necrosis, plant death ,         ,Pathways: Air spores, clothes/shoes, equipment, plant trade, green waste, animalsAt ,,,,risk:Nut industries, plantation forestry, production nurseries, urban trees, native ecosystems","Everyone needs to keep an eye out for phytophthora species. Phytophthoraspecies are oomycetes (water moulds) which look similar to fungi but their cell walls contain cellulose rather than chitin as is found in cell walls of the true Fungi. They require a moist environment (abundant water in soil or on foliage) to actively grow and reproduce.
Phytophthora ramorum causes two distinct sets of symptoms, depending on the host species. On some hosts the pathogen causes trunk cankers that usually form on the lower trunk and result in brown or black discoloured outer bark and bleeding sap. These cankers can lead to death of the tree. On other hosts, including many horticultural nursery crops, the pathogen causes a foliar blight and shoot dieback. In shrubs, leaf blight symptoms appear as dark brown spots or blotches usually occurring at the leaf tip. Eventually the leaves completely turn brown to black and then may drop prematurely. Twig blight/dieback results in shoots becoming blackened with or without foliage attached.
Phytophthora kernoviae has similar symptoms to 
         P. ramorum causing dieback and bleeding cankers. Infected shoots and leaves of plants begin to die when the plant becomes infected showing blackening down the mid-vein.â€‹

Exotic bees,http://www.agriculture.gov.au//pests-diseases-weeds/plant/exotic-bees,http://www.agriculture.gov.au//SiteCollectionImages/pests-diseases-weeds/17-exotic-bees.jpg,"Exotic to Australia (Asian honey bee under management in Cairns ,          region),Life form: Insect,Origin: Varies, depending on the species,Distribution: Asia, Africa, Middle East, North and South ,          America,Features: Various sizes up to 2cm, striped abdomens, often ,          gather in swarms,Likely pathway of entry: Imported goods, vehicles, machinery, conveyances,What is at risk: Honey, honey products, pollination-reliant ,          food crops","Everyone needs to keep an eye out for exotic bees. Many exotic bees are hard to tell from European honey bees and they may also be carrying pests such as 
     internal and external mites, so any evidence of bees entering Australia should be treated as a biosecurity risk. Bees can arrive in imported goods, including vehicles and machinery, and the conveyances and containers they come in. There may be evidence of individual bees, whole swarms, or hives.
Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) originated in Indonesia, and are now established in northern Queensland around Cairns. They are smaller and less hairy than European honey bees, and their black and yellow stripes are more pronounced. They are a natural host for 
         varroa mites, which may destroy European honey bee colonies. They are also a vector for other bee diseases and could compete with European honey bees for resources, threatening their populations. Asian honey bees are hard to manage for both honey production and pollination, and are not effective alternatives to the European honeybee.
Giant honey bees (Apis dorsata) are very large, up to 2cm long. They originated in South East Asia, and prefer tropical climates. They present a major risk to bees in Australia because they can carry parasitic mites, which could cause colony decline and death in European honey bees.
Dwarf honey bees (Apis florea) are smaller than European honey bees, and have distinctive red-brown, white and black bands on the abdomen. Their nests consist of a single comb, usually less than 25cm across. They originated in the Middle East and Africa. They can rob honey from the hives of European honey bees, as well as carry various species of damaging 
         mites.
Cape honey bees (Apis mellifera capensis) are found only in South Africa, are generally darker in colour and slightly smaller than European honey bees, although they look nearly identical. However, they have very different behaviour, swarming more often than European honey bees and store less honey. Cape honey bees are also a threat because their unique reproduction allows them to colonise the hives of other bee species, replacing the original queen.
African honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) originate from sub-Saharan Africa, are slightly smaller than European honey bees, but otherwise are not easy to distinguish. Their behaviour is quite different: they are very defensive of their nests, and hundreds of bees may attack an intruder at once, including large mammals and humans. They swarm often, up to 10 times per year, and will build nests in much smaller spaces than European honey bees. They compete for resources with European honey bees, and are harder to manage.
Africanised honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata hybrids) are hybrids of any European honey bee subspecies and African honey bees, hence the term â€˜Africanisedâ€™. They originated in South and Central America, after the introduction of African honey bees to Brazil in the 1950s. They have now reached as far north as the southern states of the USA. They are very difficult to distinguish from European honey bees, but like African honey bees they are much more aggressive. Hybridisation is a threat because a beekeeperâ€™s stock may be replaced over numerous bee generations, leaving a more aggressive and harder to manage population.

ImportersIf you work around imported goods you need to look for swarms of bees or bees and their hives attached to:vesselsshipping containersconveyances (vehicles, machinery and infrastructure components).Beekeepers and home gardenersAll beekeepers, from commercial operators, backyard enthusiasts, to people starting up their first hives, form part of the honey bee industry. Each and every beekeeper has a role to play in protecting honey bees from exotic pests. Be vigilant about bees on your property. Make sure you source your stock, such as new queens, from trusted sources, preferably certified. Keep good records of all apiary inputs. Make sure that vehicles and equipment entering and leaving your property arenâ€™t inadvertently transporting bees or hives. Monitor hives frequently, keeping an eye out for exotic invaders. Constant vigilance is essential for early detection of pest honey bees.

The first symptoms are usually the yellowing of lower or  older leaves. This yellowing progresses towards the centre of the leaf and the  leaf edges then turn brown before dying. As the lower leaves die they wilt and  collapse, forming a â€˜skirtâ€™ around the plant. The younger leaves may remain  green and upright. The stemâ€™s internal tissue discolours from yellow to red,  through to dark brown or black, depending on how long the plant has been  infected. The fruit of an infected banana plant is not affected by the fungus,  and is still safe for human consumption.      Dead plants leave behind spores that can live in soil for  decades and will infect any future banana crop plantings. When the fungus  blocks the water conducting tissue within the banana stem, it starves the plant  of water causing it to wilt and eventually die.       The symptoms of 
         Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. 
         cubense Tropical Race 4 may be confused with those of nutritional problems, water  stress, bacterial corm rot, and other diseases, which is why proper diagnosis  is important.

The nematodes are very small, less than 1mm in size and the cysts are similar size to a pin head (0.5mm). The male has a typical worm-like body, while the female becomes almost spherical after mating and appears as a cyst on root surfaces.  Both males and females are endoparasitic, which means they feed within roots. Potato cyst nematode juveniles hatch from the cysts which can contain up to 500 eggs. Once the juveniles hatch, they move between the soil particles and invade potato roots just behind the root tip. They feed on the plant root cells causing them to become very large and eventually rupture.
